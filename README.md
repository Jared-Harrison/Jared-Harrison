# 👋 Hi, I'm Jared

I'm a Computer Science student at Western University with a strong academic record and a passion for building well-structured, practical software. I enjoy tackling complex problems, breaking them down into manageable components, and turning them into clean, maintainable solutions.

Beyond coding, I value communication and mentorship. Teaching and explaining concepts—whether through tutoring, leadership roles, or collaboration—has shaped how I write and think about code.

## 🧠 How I Think as a Developer
- I focus on **clarity, structure, and correctness**
- I prefer **modular, maintainable designs** over quick fixes
- I like understanding systems end-to-end, from logic to user experience
- I learn best by building, testing, and iterating
