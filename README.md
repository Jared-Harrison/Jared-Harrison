# 👋 Hi, I'm Jared
---

I am a Computer Science student at Western University with a strong academic record and a passion for building well-structured, practical software. I love the 'puzzle' aspect of software engineering—taking a massive, messy problem and breaking it down until it's a series of clean, manageable solutions. This mindset has kept me on the Dean's Honour List at Western, but it’s also what drives my work outside the classroom. My time as a Soph leader and CSUS Director taught me that tech is a team sport; I value clear communication and mentorship just as much as a bug-free build.
