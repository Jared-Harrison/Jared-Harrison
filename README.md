# 👋 Hi, I'm Jared
---
I am a Computer Science student at Western University with a strong academic record and a passion for building well-structured, practical software. I enjoy tackling complex problems, breaking them down into manageable components, and turning them into clean, maintainable solutions.

Beyond coding, I value communication and mentorship. Teaching and explaining concepts—whether through tutoring, leadership roles, or collaboration—has shaped how I write and think about code.
